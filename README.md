# Team Serendipity: CS354p Final Project
##### Welcome to our **Final Game Project**!
Our finalized, working code is stored on our `codefreeze` branch.

Our _**Alpha Report**_ can be found here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1JS10h2ct08d1U--IQM-fSsFgsuIOpkfjNbIW_d2dNGE/edit?usp=sharing

## Game Objective Summary (Current Implementation)
Our game is a 3d traditional turn-based RPG with emphasis on our party-based combat system.

In the overworld, the player explores dungeons. When they comes into range with an Enemy (currently a cube), we switch into the Battle mode. When the player escapes or the round ends (either the player or the enemy dies), they are transported back into the overworld.

### Player Controls
| Key | Action |
| ------ | ------ |
| W | Forward |
| A | Left |
| S | Backward |
| D | Right |
| Mouse | Move to Pan Camera |

> The above controls are only for the Overworld. In the battles, the player is expected to only click on the UI displayed.
